Working Hypothesis and Environment
======================================

#. System's Features: The robot URDF which is used in this package was able to detect the markers with a camera mounted on a 5 dof manipulator. Additionally, it could find the best path to the target point while it generated the map in an online simultanious manner.

#. System's Limitations: Battery level is the main limitation in this experiment, although it has chosen high enough to make the robot able to patrol the environment more conveniently.

#. Possible Technical Improvements: The robot could have been designed in such a way that there was a balance between the base and manipulator to avoid swinging in real case scenario. Of course, the ontology part could have been more comprehensive considering the power of PELLET reosoner.
